PROJECT STATUS: CAVEAT EMPTOR

This is an unstable preview release. I'm open sourcing some of Facebook's
internal tools, but they'll be unstable for at least a couple months.

WHAT IS LIBPHUTIL?

libphutil is a collection of utility classes and functions for PHP.

Futures
  Futures (also known as "promises") are objects which act as placeholders for
  some future result of computation. They let you express parallel and
  asynchronous execution with a natural syntax. There are two provided concrete
  Future implementations:
    ExecFuture: execute system commands with a Future-based API
    HTTPFuture: execute simple HTTP requests with a Future-based API
    execx(): exception-based alternative to exec() with more capabilities
    
Filesystem
  The builtin PHP filesystem functions return error codes and emit warnings.
  It is tedious to check these consistently. The Filesystem class provides a
  simple API for common filesystem operations that throws exceptions on failure.

xsprintf
  This module allows you to build sprintf()-style functions that have arbitrary
  conversions. This is particularly useful for escaping data correctly. Three
  concrete implementations are provided:
    csprintf: safely escape data for system commands
    jsprintf: safely escape data for Javascript
    qsprintf: safely escape data for MySQL
